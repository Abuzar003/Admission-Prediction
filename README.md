# Admission-Prediction
This project predicts student admissions based on features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP strength, LOR strength, GPA, and research experience. It uses machine learning algorithms to make these predictions.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) on the processed data.
Evaluation: Assesses the model using R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
Prediction: Estimates the chances of admission for new applicants.
